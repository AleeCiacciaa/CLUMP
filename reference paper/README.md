# Theoretical References - Study on CLUMP and KER

In this folder are collected some scientific papers in PDF format that represent the main theoretical references used to understand the concepts behind the study of **CLUMP** and **KER**.

The selected papers cover fundamental topics related to the formation, structure and analysis of clumps, as well as the methodologies and theories associated with the KER parameter.

One of the main software used for analysis is **MADCUBA** (*Madrid Data Cube Analysis on ImageJ*), an interactive tool for analysing spectral data and FITS cubes, widely used in astrophysics to study spectral lines and obtain physical and kinematic information from observations.

This collection is designed to support theoretical investigation and provide a solid scientific context to the current study.
