# CLUMP - ALMAGAL Cube Data
This repository contains scripts and data related to the analysis of continuum emission from ALMAGAL survey sources.
Some .fits files exceed GitHubâ€™s maximum upload limit (100 MB), therefore they are hosted externally.

**Download from Google Drive**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17EGJRGuUTHJSTCNAc0NgRK82vkL1zhQX/view?usp=drive_link

Only two .fits files were used in the code:
- '124103_spw0_7MTM2_jointdeconv.image.fits'
- '124103_spw1_7MTM2_jointdeconv.image.fits'

Folder Structure: 
- 'combined-line-fits/almagal/124103_spw0_7MTM2_jointdeconv.image.fits'
- 'combined-line-fits/almagal/124103_spw1_7MTM2_jointdeconv.image.fits'
